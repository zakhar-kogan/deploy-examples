# Deploy Hummingbot Instance

This installs a single [Hummingbot](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot) instance as a Docker container.

## Prerequisites

This configuration requires [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. The recommended way to get Docker Compose is to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), which includes Docker Compose along with Docker Engine and Docker CLI which are Compose prerequisites.

See [Docker](../DOCKER.md) for more information about how to install and use Docker Compose, as well as helpful commands.

## Getting Started

Verify that Docker Compose is installed correctly by checking the version:

```bash
docker compose version
```

The output should be: `Docker Compose version v2.17.2` or similar. Ensure that you are using Docker Compose V2, as V1 is deprecated.

### 1. Launch network

Clone this repo to your machine and go to the folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy-examples.git
cd deploy-examples/simple_hummingbot_compose
```

Alternatively, copy the `docker-compose.yml` file to a directory on your machine where you want to store your Hummingbot files. 

This is the "root folder" where your encrypted keys, scripts, trades, configs, logs, and other files related to your bots will be saved.

From the root folder, run the following command to pull the image and start the instance:
```
docker compose up -d
```

After the images have been downloaded, you should see the following output:
```
[+] Running 1/1
 â ¿ Container hummingbot  Started 
 ```

### 2. Set permissions

Run this command from your root folder to grant read/write permission to the `hummingbot_files` sub-folder:
```
sudo chmod -R a+rw ./hummingbot_files
```

### 3. Populate scripts folder with example scripts
Run this command to copy the sample scripts into the `scripts` folder. Any new scripts you add here will also be available to your `hummingbot` instance.
```
docker cp hummingbot:/home/hummingbot/pmm_scripts/. ./hummingbot_files/scripts/
```

### 4. Launch Hummingbot

Attach to the `hummingbot` instance:
```
docker attach hummingbot
```

You should see the Hummingbot welcome screen:

## Updating to the Latest Version of Hummingbot

Hummingbot and Hummingbot Gateway are updated on a monthly basis, with each new version marked by a code release on Github and DockerHub, accompanied by the publication of comprehensive release notes. To upgrade to the most recent version, you just need to pull the `latest` Docker images.

Follow the steps below to upgrade your Hummingbot system:

1. **Ensure no containers are running**

   Before you initiate the update process, it is crucial to verify that no Docker containers are currently running. Use the following command to shut down any active containers:

   ```
   docker compose down
   ```

2. **Fetch the latest Docker image**

   Once you have confirmed that no containers are running, proceed to pull the latest Docker image. Use the following command to accomplish this:

   ```
   docker pull hummingbot/hummingbot
   ```

3. **Start the updated containers**

   Having pulled the latest Docker image, you can now start up your containers. They will be running the latest version of Hummingbot. Use the following command to start the containers:

   ```
   docker compose up -d
   ```

With these steps, you will have successfully updated your Hummingbot to the latest version.
